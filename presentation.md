Summary 
========================================================
- Objective: 
<small style="font-size:.7em">
To develop a simple tool to view trends on the natural events occurring across the United States and the impact of the events on the economy (damage to Crops and Properties) and human lives (Deaths and Injuries), and identify the top contenders in reference to the year, event type, and state
</small>  

- The Application:
<small style="font-size:.7em">
Built in shiny, this application provides three widgets to:
(i) Select and aggregate the data by year, event type, and state. 
(ii) Select the total count, impact on economy, and impact on health.
(iii) Select and zoom on the top N (1:50) values.
</small>

- Source: 
<small style="font-size:.7em">
For this application we used the 2001-2013 storm data from the National Climate Data Center of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/.
